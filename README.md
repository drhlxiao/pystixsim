# STIX imager simulator 
Stix Sim is a simulator for the Stix imager. It allows for the simulation of patterns observed by Stix from any random source shapes. 
In this simulator, each grid is described as a set of polygons. These polygons are then projected onto the detector plane, 
and the illuminated area on each pixel is determined using boolean operations with the shadows of the front and rear grids.

Please send me email hualin.xiao(at)fhnw.ch if you are interested in using it. 

The simulator has been used for the following work:
* Image classification and reconstruction using machine learning <br>
